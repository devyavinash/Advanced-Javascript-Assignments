# Async JavaScript Assignments

## Overview
A collection of JavaScript assignments focused on asynchronous programming patterns. Students implement solutions in source files and validate them by running Jest tests. There is no frontend or backend server — this is a pure Node.js + Jest project.

## Project Architecture
- **Language**: JavaScript (Node.js 20)
- **Test Framework**: Jest 29
- **Package Manager**: npm

### Directory Structure
- `callbacks/` — Callback-based assignments (easy, medium, hard)
- `promises/` — Promise-based assignments (easy, medium, hard)
- `cpu-io/` — CPU/IO-related async assignments (easy, medium, hard)
- `tests/` — Jest test files for all assignments

## Running Tests
- Run all tests: `npm run all`
- Run a specific test: `npm run <testName>` (e.g., `npm run sleep`)
- See `package.json` scripts for the full list of available test commands.
